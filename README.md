# FEAssignment2
in this assignment when you open it at first glance the website looks up to stardard but when looking closer you will see that some information(from the api) is not being diplayed fully, this is because i was able to find the best method in order to fetch/show the needed information from the API. Although i was not able to fetch the needed information, my javascript does have the needed code. the html code does have alot of hardcoded markup code this was left just as placeholders to see what needs to be where. the javascript does also have the proper way inorder to display the code onto the webpage, i just was not able to fetch the data - as i was not taught javascript to this fully extend, i tried to find the best solutions that i could use in order to make the program work but i seem to have not successed in that aspect. i have meant your expectations in some situations.

#Instructions for compiling and running the code <br>
i first started off by making a connection to the Rest API in order to gain the needed data. after i made sure the console was able to see the data i then started on my html code - basically typing out the website with the needed ids/classes. while i was busy with the code, i was almost adding my css along side of it.

#Brief overview of the architecture <br>
on this webpage, there is an image of the product on the left-hand side, in the middle is the information related to the product and on the left is a box with some shipping information and the final total.

#Short summary of your choice of technology stack - why did you choose it and if you were to do it again, would you change anything?<br>
my choice of technlogy technology stack was html, css and javascript. these three were the options i was most comfortable with, although i am not the best with javascript i enjoyed teaching myself something - in more depth. i would add a bit more of other languages to help me out just a bit more, but other than that good.

i enjoyed the challenge that came along with this assignment, it was good too see where my stregths and weaknesses lay.
